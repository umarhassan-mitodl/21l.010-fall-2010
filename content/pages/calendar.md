**Topic:** Sonnets and Speeches: An Introduction.

**Objectives:** Speaking and analyzing lines that have become among the most famous in the English language, we will begin to be comfortable using our own voices as instruments for communication and expression. We will establish a basic vocabulary for the analysis of Shakespeare's verse, paying special attention to early modern syntax and rhetorical devices, and noting how these do and do not differ from our own. You will share your written assessment of the skills and experiences you bring to this subject, and begin to help one another interpret and edit.
